# dileepabandara.dev (Web Build Branch)

This branch contains the `web build` files that are used to deploy the application to a web server. If you are looking for the source code, please switch to the `main` branch.

## 💫 Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have the build files for the application. You can either build the application yourself or download the pre-built files from the `web-build` branch.

If you are looking for to download the pre-built files, you can simply select the `web-build` branch, download the `zip` file, and extract it to your local machine or web server.

## ⚙️ Building the Application

If you want to build the application and get the files yourself, you can download the source code from the `main` branch and setup the project. Once you have the project setup, you can build the application using the following command:

```md
flutter build web --release
```

This will generate a `build` directory containing the compiled code for your application. The `build` directory will contain the files and folders just like the `web-build` branch.

## 🚀 Deploying the Application

To deploy the application to a web server, you can copy the contents of the `build` directory to your server. Make sure your server is configured to serve static files from the directory you choose to deploy the application.

There are many ways to deploy the application to a web server. You can use whatever method you are comfortable with. I personally used GitHub Pages to deploy this application.
